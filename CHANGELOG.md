#MOVES
====
General Changes:
----
* **Ghost and Dark have had their attacking stats swapped: Ghost-type moves use Special Attack, and Dark-type moves use physical Attack.**
* Multi-hit moves have a chance to proc effects (e.g. King's Rock flinch, Twineedle poison) every hit.
* As in Sun/Moon, some Pokemon will now learn a move upon evolution as opposed to at a specific level.
* TMs are now reusable and will not be consumed when used.
